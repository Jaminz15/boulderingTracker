# BoulderBook: A Bouldering Progress Tracking App

This repository serves as the Individual Project for Madison College's Enterprise Java Class.

## Problem Statement

Bouldering has become an increasingly popular sport, offering climbers a dynamic and engaging way to challenge 
themselves. However, despite the growth of indoor climbing gyms and outdoor climbing spots, there is no widely 
adopted system for tracking individual progress. Most climbing gyms do not provide a way to log climbs, track 
different styles, or analyze long-term improvement.

To address this gap, BoulderBook is a Java-based web application designed to help climbers log their sessions, track 
their progress, and analyze their climbing history. With BoulderBook, users can:

- Log their climbing sessions and choose the type of climb, such as slab, overhang, dyno, etc.
- Record grades and track their progress over time.
- Keep track of the gyms they visit and log climbs under each gym.
- Use filtering to see the average level of climbs they complete, set personal goals, and stay motivated.

When climbing indoors, BoulderBook will help climbers stay motivated, track their progress, and improve their skills.
