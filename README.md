# BoulderBook: A Bouldering Progress Tracking App

## Problem Statement
Many climbing gyms do not provide a way for climbers to track their progress, log climbs, or analyze improvements over 
time. Climbers often rely on memory or scattered notes to keep track of their ascents, making it difficult to see trends 
in their performance or compare results across different locations.

BoulderBook aims to solve this problem by providing a web-based logging system for bouldering enthusiasts. The 
application will allow users to log climbing sessions, record the types of climbs they attempt (slab, overhang, dyno, 
etc.), track their climbing grades, upload pictures, and associate their climbs with specific gyms. This will enable 
users to compare their performance across different climbing locations and monitor their progress over time.
